#George's experiments
print()     #is this a space or new line?
print("")   #ditto
print("1" "1")    #"no comma"
print("2","2")    #comma makes a space
print('2')  #works as well
print(2)    #a literal
#print "not python",2

#Experiments below: (The minimum above gives you a "B", what follows gives you the "A")

print(5+5) #Testing math in Python
#Success

print('Boo!') #Testing if single quotes work too
#Success

print("Huh...'") #Testing whether a quote will print as a quote when in "quotes"
#Success
'''
print(5+5)('is still ten') #Testing multiple parentheses in one line, back-to-back
#Failure
'''
print(5+5,'is still ten') #Testing multiple arguments inside parentheses
#Success (when a comma is used to separate)
